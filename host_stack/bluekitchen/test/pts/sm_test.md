# SM Test

The tests for Cross-Transport Key-Generation require a Dual-Mode Controller with support for BR/EDR Secure Connections.
The need for BR/EDR SC is not listed in SM.TS.p19. CTKG works well without BR/EDR Secure Connections again iOS.

For unknown reasons, the Laird BT851 00:16:A4:4A:3C:C5 does not pick up advertisements from the Bluetooth 5.0 PTS 00:1B:DC:08:E2:xx dongles.
Current test device: the other Bluetooth 5.0 PTS dongle
