 *  to 1, all STM32 interrupts are masked with the PRIMASK bit of the CortexM CPU. It is possible to use the BASEPRI
 *  register of the CortexM CPU to keep allowed some interrupts with high priority. In that case, the user shall

   * A relaxed timing would be 10ms
   * When the value is too short, the timerserver will not be able to count properly and all timeout may be random.
   * When the value is too long, the device may wake up more often than the most optimal configuration. However, the
   * impact on power consumption would be marginal (unless the value selected is extremely too long). It is strongly
   * recommended to select a value large enough to make sure it is not too short to ensure reliability of the system
