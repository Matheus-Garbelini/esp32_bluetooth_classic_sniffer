# BTstack Arduino Manual

Thanks for checking out BTstack on the Arduino platform!

In this manual, we first provide a quick tutorial that helps install the BTstack Library for the Arduino IDE and gets you started with the examples.

In the second part, we'll explain the examples to get you starting with creating your own Sketches that use the BTstack LE Arduino Shield.

## Supported Harware 

It should work with any board that provides at least 64 kB Flash and a working SPI driver. 
So far, we did test the BTstack LE Arduino Shield together with these Arduino boards:

- Arduino Zero
- Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- Arduino Mega 2560 
- Arduino Mega 1280 
- Sparkfun Mega 3.3

Please let us know if you got it working with other Arduino clones.
